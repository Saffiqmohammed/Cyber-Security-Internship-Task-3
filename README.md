# Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding fundamental networking concepts by capturing and analyzing real-time network traffic. The analysis was performed using Wireshark, a widely used network packet analyzer. The task provides practical exposure to how data flows across a network and how different protocols operate during normal internet usage.

---

## Tool Used
- **Wireshark** – Network packet capture and analysis tool

---

## Objective
The main objective of this task is to learn basic networking concepts by capturing and analyzing live network traffic. This includes understanding how DNS, TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols function and how network communication is secured using encryption.

---

## Key Observations
- **DNS Analysis:**  
  Observed DNS packets that show how domain names are resolved into IP addresses before a connection is established.

- **TCP Traffic:**  
  Analyzed TCP communication and identified the three-way handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), which ensures reliable connections.

- **HTTP vs HTTPS:**  
  HTTP traffic was visible in plain text, while HTTPS and TLS traffic appeared encrypted, highlighting the importance of secure communication.

- **Protocol Filtering:**  
  Used protocol filters such as `dns`, `tcp`, and `http` to efficiently analyze specific types of network traffic.

## Security Relevance
Network traffic analysis plays a vital role in cyber security. It helps detect unusual or suspicious activities such as unauthorized access attempts, malware communication, and data leakage. Encryption protects sensitive data during transmission, and DNS monitoring can help identify access to potentially malicious websites.

---

## Conclusion
This task improved the understanding of core networking concepts and demonstrated the practical use of Wireshark in cyber security. It highlights how packet analysis is essential for monitoring, analyzing, and securing network communications.
